**Today's Progress**: Build my first HTML5 website

**Thoughts:** Learn basic html5 to create my first web site in one day. It is very easy with the help of documentation on w3c.org and mdn from mozilla. In this lesson i learn about opening and closing tag, void tag, semantic tag, and a little bit css to manage the alignment of the web site page.
